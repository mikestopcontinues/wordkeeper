> "You can't manage what you can't measure."

This axiom is as true for writing as any other skill. If you want to improve, you need good data--and lots of it.

**WordKeeper** aims to help you build a performance history of your writing sprints, then analyze that history, offering insights and metrics for how you can improve.
